Upon completion of this lesson, you will be able to:
es	Understand what is Percentage
Learn to do the percentage calculations
Know the different types of problems in percentage
Learn to solve the problems in the most effective way
Apply the formula for Successive Percentage Change


	Percentage:	When a quantity is expressed out of 100, it is known as Percentage.
For example - if a student has scored 400 out of 600 total marks, then student’s percentage marks = 400/600100 = 66.66%. It means that – had the full marks been 100, this student would have achieved 66.66 marks.

		Percentage is represented by the symbol ‘%’.

<p>(d) 2x&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>3y&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>4z</p>

<p><strong>Solution:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>To solve these questions, it is best to assume the values of x, y and z and verify the options one by one.</p>

<p>Assume x&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">=</span>5, y&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">=</span>3 and z&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">=</span>1</p>

<p>Verifying option (a) x&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>y&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>z&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">=</span>5&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>3&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>1&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">=</span>9.

<p>Verifying option (b) x - y&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>z&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">=</span>5 - 3&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>1&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">=</span>3. This is an odd number. Hence option (b) is not the answer.</p>

<p>Verifying option (c) x&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>2y&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>3z&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">=</span>5&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>6&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>3&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">=</span>14. This is an even number. Hence option (c) is the answer.</p>

This is an odd number. Hence option (d) is not the answer.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong>p, q, r and s are four natural numbers. Two of these are odd and other two are even, though we do not know which two are even and other two are odd. Which of the following will MUST be an Even Integer?</p>

<p>(a) p&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>q&nbsp;</p>

<p>(b) p - r</p>

<p>(d) 2p&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>3q&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>4r</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>At first, note that to solve this question, you will not be able to assume values as question does not provide the exact nature of the numbers a, b, c and d. The only point given is &ndash;
    two of these are Odd and other two are even.</p>

<p>Further, since question is asking for &ldquo;Must be&rdquo; an even number, an option can be eliminated if it gets an Odd number at the end.</p>

<p>Let us verify the options one by one:</p>

<p>Option (a) p&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>q</p>

<p>Option (a) p&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>q can be an odd number if p is an odd number and q is an even number. Hence option (a) will be eliminated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Option (b) p - r</p>

<p>Option (b) p - r can be an odd number if p is an odd number and r is an even number. Hence option (b) will be eliminated.</p>

<p>Option (c) p&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>q&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>r &ndash;
    s contains two odd numbers and two even numbers. Resultant of two odd numbers will be always even number and resultant of two even numbers will be an even number. Finally resultant of these even numbers will again be an even number. Hence option (c) is the answer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Option (d) 2p&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>3q&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">+</span>4r can be an odd number if p is an odd number, q is an odd number and r is an even number. Hence option (d) will be eliminated.</p>

    <string name="content_divisibility_rule">"<p>Using divisibility rules of any number, one can identify if a number is divisible by other number or not, without going through the actual division process.</p>

<p>Following is the list divisibility rules of some of the natural numbers:</p>

<p><strong>A number is divisible by 2 &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>If unit digit of the number is 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8.</p>

<p><strong>A number is divisible by 3 -&nbsp;</strong>If sum of digits of the number is divisible by 3.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A number is divisible by 4 &ndash;</strong>If number formed by the last two digits of the number is divisible by 4.</p>

<p><strong>A number is divisible by</strong><strong><span>5-&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If last digit of the number is either 5 or 0.</span></p>

<p><strong>A number is divisible by</strong><strong><span>6 -</span></strong><span>If the unit digit of the number is 0 or 2 or 4 or 6 or 8 and sum of all the digits of number is divisible by 3.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>A number is divisible by</strong><strong><span>8 &ndash;&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If number formed by the last 3 digits of the number is divisible by 8.</span></p>

<p><strong>A number is divisible by</strong><strong><span>9 -&nbsp;</span></strong><span>I</span><span>f sum of digits of the number is divisible by 9.</span></p>

<p><strong>A number is divisible by</strong><strong><span>10 &ndash;&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If the unit digit of the number is 0.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>A number is divisible by</strong><strong><span>11-</span></strong><span>if the difference between the sum of the digits at the even places and the sum of the digits at the odd places is divisible by 11(zero is divisible by 11).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>For example - 4553109 is divisible by 11 as the difference of 4+5+1+9=19 and 5+3+0=8 is 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>A number is divisible by</strong><strong><span>12 &ndash;</span></strong><span>If a number is divisible by 3 and 4, then the number will be divisible by 12.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>A number is divisible by</strong><strong><span>16 -&nbsp;</span></strong><span>if a number formed by the last 4 digits of the given number is divisible by 16.</span></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Process to define the divisibility rule of any prime number:</strong></p>

<p>Any prime number greater than 5 will end up either in 10N+1 or 10N-1 within its 1<sup>st</sup>10 multiples. In other words, any prime number greater than 5 will give unit digit either 1 or 9 within its 1<sup>st</sup>10 multiples.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Step 1: Defining Seed Number of the prime number</p>

<p>This multiple is written in the format of 10N+1 or 10N-1. N is known as the seed of that prime number<strong>.</strong><strong><span style="letter-spacing:0.25pt; line-height:22px">Seed numbers are taken negative in case of + 1 and&nbsp;positive in the case of -1. For example &ndash;

<p><strong><span style="letter-spacing:0.25pt; line-height:22px">So the seed number of 13 = 4 and (-9).</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="letter-spacing:0.25pt; line-height:22px">Step 2: Generating the divisibility rule</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="letter-spacing:0.25pt; line-height:22px">If the seed number is N, then the divisibility rule = A + NB and if the seed number = (-N), then the divisibility rule = A &ndash;

In the year 2015, he got an increment of 25% over his salary in 2014. In the year 2016, he got an increment of 20% over his salary in 2015.</span></p>

<p><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be seen that the percentage increment in Bill&rsquo;s salary occur on the previous year&rsquo;s salary in 2015 as well as in 2016. So, the increment happens &lsquo;in succession&rsquo;
    for each of the years. In other words, percentage increment in 2016 does NOT happen over his salary in 2014.</span></p>

<p><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">This is what we know as Successive Percentage Change.</span></p>

<p><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">To find out Bill&rsquo;s monthly salary in 2016, you can apply either percentage change method one by one for each of the years, or, you can simply use the formula for successive percentage change.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Method 2 &ndash;</span></strong><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt"> Formula for Successive Percentage Change </span></p>

<p>If there are two successive percentage increase of x% and y%, then net percentage change = (x + y + <span style="position:relative; top:6.0pt"><img alt="" height="32" src="file:///C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image006.gif" width="19" /></span>)%</p>

<p>In the example given above, x = 25% and y = 20%</p>

<p>Then net percentage change = (25 + 20 + <span style="position:relative; top:6.0pt"><img alt="" height="33" src="file:///C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image008.gif" width="31" /></span>)% = 50%</p>

<p>Hence Bill&rsquo;s monthly salary in 2016 will be 50% more than his monthly salary in 2014.</p>

<p>Bill&rsquo;s monthly salary in 2016 = Bill&rsquo;s monthly salary in 2014 + 50% of Bill&rsquo;s monthly salary in 2016 = USD 600 + 50% of USD 600 = USD 600 + USD <span style="position:relative; top:6.0pt"><img alt="" height="33" src="file:///C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image010.gif" width="41" /></span>&nbsp;= USD 600 + USD 300 = USD 900</p>

<p>Note it!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is percentage increase, then plus sign (+) will be used; if there is percentage decrease, then minus sign (-) will be used</p>

<p>For example, if there are two successive percentage changes of x% increase and y% decrease, then net percentage change = (x - y + <span style="position:relative; top:6.0pt"><img alt="" height="34" src="file:///C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image014.gif" width="30" /></span>)% = (x - y - <span style="position:relative; top:6.0pt"><img alt="" height="32" src="file:///C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image006.gif" width="19" /></span>)%</p>

<p>Similarly, if there are two successive percentage changes of x% decrease and y% decrease, then net percentage change = (-x - y + <span style="position:relative; top:6.0pt"><img alt="" height="34" src="file:///C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image016.gif" width="47" /></span>)% = (-x - y + <span style="position:relative; top:6.0pt"><img alt="" height="32" src="file:///C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image006.gif" width="19" /></span>)%</p>

        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"
